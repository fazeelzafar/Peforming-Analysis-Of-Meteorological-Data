# Peforming-Analysis-Of-Meteorological-Data

The hypothesis of this project states:
 "Has the Apparent Temperature and Humidity compared monthly across 10 years of data indicate an increase due to global warming?"
 
I had to analyze and data and predict whether this hypothesis is justified or not. Using the skills that I had acquired, I performed Data Cleaning, Prepared the Data and created Visualization for this data.
